# Hydra 
An annoying app, inspired from the site https://www.windows93.net/ written in SwiftUI.
Currently, all the windows spawn in the same location - but it's almost 5am, and I don't feel sane enough to continue coding this. Patch s0n, when I can position windows.

# WARNING
Yes, this application is an annoyance.
CMD + Q will work on it, but the red UI button will NOT, and will spawn 2 more Hydra windows (as macOS does not have a built in OK button)
Could this be malware? Not really. You can quit it.
Sometimes, quitting it can leave a GHOST window. See issues for this.

## Installation
Use the build in Releases, or compile yourself with the Xcode project in the source. You can modify strings and code, if you like.

## Issues
Q: There are ghost windows showing up! My Mac is showing the beach ball! How do I quit them?

Simply wait for them to vanish, or log out.


Q: How do I quit Hydra?

CMD + Q, or the Force Quit menu. 


Q: How garbage is this?

Very.

## Screenshots
TBA, when source code is added
