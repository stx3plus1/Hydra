# Hydra 
An annoying app, inspired from the site https://www.windows93.net/ written in SwiftUI.

I still exist - patching an annoying bug right now where EVERY window will spawn the new Hydra clone - basic positioning works!

# WARNING
Yes, this application is an annoyance.

CMD + Q sometimes works on it, but the red UI button will NOT, and will spawn 2 more Hydra windows (as macOS does not have a built in OK button)

PLEASE **FOR THE LOVE OF GOD** USE FORCE QUIT IF YOU DON'T WANT A HEADACHE.

## Installation
Use the build in Releases, or compile yourself with the Xcode project in the source. You can modify strings and code, if you like.

## Issues
Q: There are ghost windows showing up! My Mac is showing the beach ball! How do I quit them?

Simply wait for them to vanish, or log out.


Q: How do I quit Hydra?

CMD + Q, or the Force Quit menu. 


Q: How garbage is this?

Very.
